<p> Below is a screenshot of the fill features that are either not available or I can't find
     in the version I am using. I cannot create the gradient as instructed. My polygon and star
    were combined at some point so grouping the shapes with the text is not working for me either. Since I
was not able to create the gradient as intended, I increased the shadow on the name so it could be seen better with the part of the gradient I was able to make.</p>
